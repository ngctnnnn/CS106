# Solving knapsack with OR Tools and Genetic Algorithm
This is my repo for CS106 - Artificial Intelligence - homework   

## How to run 
Randomize a new dataset (Optional)     
`python3 generate_data.py`     
### With Google OR Tools
**Step 1**: Create the dataset by the means of randomizing    
`python3 data.py`     
**Step 2**: Run the main program    
`make file=OR`
### With Genetic Algorithm     
`make file=GA`
