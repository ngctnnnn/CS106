abstract = {Abstract We provide an exact optimization algorithm for the electric vehicle routing problem with multiple recharge technologies. Our branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm relies upon a path-based formulation, where each column in the master problem represents a sequence of customer visits between two recharge stations instead of a whole route. This allows for massive decomposition, and parallel implementation of the pricing phase, exploiting the large number of independent pricing sub-problems. The algorithm could solve instances with up to thirty customers, nine recharge stations, five vehicles and three technologies to proven optimality. Near-optimal heuristic solutions were obtained with a general-purpose MIP solver from the columns generated at the root node.},

abstract = {The paper is concerned with the optimum routing of a fleet of gasoline delivery trucks
between a bulk terminal and a large number of service stations supplied by the terminal.
The shortest routes between any two points in the system are given and a demand for
one or several products is specified for a number of stations within the distribution
system. It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner
that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum
A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near
optimal solution. The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic
digital computing machine. No practical applications of the method have been made
as yet. A number of trial problems have been calculated, however.},

considering certain theoretical aspects of the problem, develops an iterative procedure
