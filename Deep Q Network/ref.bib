abstract="This chapter outlines the research, development and perspectives of quantum neural networks - a burgeoning new field which integrates classical neurocomputing with quantum computation [1]. It is argued that the study of quantum neural networks may give us both new understanding of brain function as well as unprecedented possibilities in creating new systems for information processing, including solving classically intractable problems, associative memory with exponential capacity and possibly overcoming the limitations posed by the Church-Turing thesis.",

The history of neural networks has been divided in four stages: Beginning of neural networks, First golden age, Quiet Years and Renewed enthusiasm which shows the interplay among biological experimentation, modeling and computer simulation, hardware implementation.",
